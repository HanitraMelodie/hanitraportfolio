            I am a passionate full-stack developer with a keen focus on
            front-end development (Typescript/React). I am on a journey to
            expand my experiences and skills in web development.

          <h4>Ki backend service code migration</h4>
          <p>
            During the backend service migration from C# to Kotlin, I was
            responsible for monitoring and updating the E2E tests for Energy,
            Lawyer Professional and Marine. By increasing the E2E tests
            coverage, I discovered a bug on the Marine Hull business class. This
            E2E coverage improvement was one of the reasons we were able to
            deliver a better-quality backend codebase during the migration.
          </p>
          <h4>Additional capacity for multiple syndicates feature</h4>

          <p>
            While working on my team tasks, I decided to engage with two design
            sprints for the new feature (being able to quote against two
            additional syndicates), it was a very early design sessions and
            discussions. It was essential for me to be involved in these
            discussions as I was aware of how this new feature will drastically
            change Ki business and the insurance business. I am proud that two
            of my designs ideas have been used on the final design.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the preparation of the launch for the additional capacity
            from multiple syndicates feature,I completed 10 front‚Äêend tickets on
            the operation platform to support this new feature.I in unit tests
            coverage for the operation platform codebase and added as well unit
            tests .
          </p>
          <p>
            To support the new feature, I participated to the creation of an
            additional partner platform : I set up Error logs tracker Sentry to
            have daily error reports on production and demo environments on a Ki
            partner platform. It improved the way we track error recurrences and
            gave more visiblity to error reoccurence. I was responsible to
            report and investigate errors reported on Sentry.I added as well
            unit tests and E2E tests coverage on the partner platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a better user experience, I decided to create a ticket to make
            the Ki partner platform more responsive. It was not on the JIRA
            board but it was a small task and I know it would be a nice-to-have
            feature for our platform, therefore I created the ticket and
            implemented responsive design to the Ki partner platform.

            The final project to showcase what we learnt during the 3 months
            classes was a team project to create a React application. I found
            the idea of creating a Music Therapy application very exciting.
            Indeed, my teammate and I were passionate of music and we wanted to
            create something to help us and other to cope with stress in a fun
            and entertaining way. We were only two in my team. It was intense to
            complete this project. I create the first design of the website on
