          <p>Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹</p>

            I am a passionate full-stack developer with a keen focus on
            front-end development (Typescript/React). I am on a journey to
            expand my experiences and skills in web development.

          <h4>Ki backend service code migration</h4>
          <p>
            During the migration of the backend service from C# to Kotlin, I was
            tasked with monitoring and updating the E2E tests for Energy, Lawyer
            Professional, and Marine. By expanding the E2E test coverage, I
            uncovered a bug in the Marine Hull business class. This enhancement
            in E2E coverage played a significant role in delivering a
            higher-quality backend codebase during the migration.
          </p>
          <h4>Additional capacity for multiple syndicates feature</h4>

          <p>
            While working on my team tasks, I actively participated in two
            design sprints for the new feature, enabling quoting against two
            additional syndicates. These were early design sessions and
            discussions, and it was crucial for me to be involved as I
            understood how this new feature would significantly impact Ki&apos;s
            business and the insurance industry. I am proud that two of my
            design ideas were incorporated into the final design.
          </p>

          <p>
            In preparation for the launch of the additional capacity from
            multiple syndicates feature, I completed 10 frontend tickets on the
            operation platform to support this new functionality. I also
            increased unit test coverage for the operation platform codebase and
            added new unit tests.
          </p>
          <p>
            To support the new feature, I contributed to the creation of an
            additional partner platform. I implemented the Error Logs Tracker
            Sentry to receive daily error reports on production and demo
            environments for the Ki partner platform. This enhancement improved
            our error tracking capabilities and provided greater visibility into
            error recurrences. I was responsible for reporting and investigating
            errors reported on Sentry. Additionally, I added unit tests and E2E
            test coverage to the partner platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the importance of a better user experience, I initiated
            the creation of a ticket to make the Ki partner platform more
            responsive. Although it was not initially on the JIRA board, I
            recognized its significance as a nice-to-have feature for our
            platform, and thus, I created the ticket and implemented responsive
            design for the Ki partner platform.

            The final project, showcasing what we learned during the three
            months of classes, was a team effort to create a React application.
            I found the idea of developing a Music Therapy application very
            exciting. Indeed, my teammate and I were passionate about music and
            wanted to create something to help us and others cope with stress in
            a fun and entertaining way. With only two members in our team, it
            was intense to complete this project. I created the initial design
            of the website using Figma{" "}
